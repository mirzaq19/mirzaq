              Hello! My name is Mirzaq and let me talk about myself. I decided
              to start exploring about web development in August 2021 especially
              on front-end development. I&apos;ve tried to take various courses
              on web development such as on youtube and online learning
              platforms like Dicoding.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are so many things to learn about website development, but
              with enthusiasm I will try to learn it. With trial and error I
              will try to continue to improve my ability to make myself better
            </p>
            <p>
              And by looking at the times that are now entering the 4.0
              industrial revolution, I don&apos;t only have programming skills.
              I also have several skills such as video editing, graphic design,
              and UI/UX design.
            </p>
